# Core Vanilla JavaScript - Team Practice

A marathon of pair exercises in pure javascript. Capped with a final project.

### Exercism

Exercism provides a number of practice problems along with unit tests to ensure the accuracy of your answer to the test problems. We will be using exercism challenges for the first three days of this goal.

#### Setup

All of the Exercism exercises can be done from the comfort of your own command line. This will require some configuration and setup on your part.

1. Install jasmine-node `npm install jasmine-node -g` This is the test framework we will use to run the tests
2. Using the terminal, browse to the `exercism` folder in this folder
3. For each of the following challenges, update the .js file to make the tests pass. You can run the tests by running `jasmine-node .`
4. Make sure to commit your repo with the update js file, and the marked checkbox in this file, and push to github after every challenge is done
